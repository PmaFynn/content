Yesterday, I stumbled across the [Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung (bpb)](https://www.bpb.de/) via a [tweet](https://x.com/theoriebarbaren/status/1903893713291546659) linking to the 1400-page [study of the history of the Russian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_of_Government). And honestly, what the heck? How have I never heard of this resource? After looking into it for a few minutes, I was even more surprised. It turns out the [Landeszentrale für politische Bildung NRW (lpb.nrw)](https://www.politische-bildung.nrw/) also offers something incredible. They don’t just offer books at a cheap price but almost for free. You can pay 12 euros to receive any six of the available books (e.g., Adam Tooze's *Welt im Lockdown*)—once per year per resident of NRW. 

I’m writing this blog post to embed these sites into my mind so I can check out new releases from time to time. Furthermore, I have no one to share this with, because hardly anyone I know reads non-fiction :D
